# Extremly short interlaced story (EU 2014)

## Don&#8217;t interlace me !

### HD case 1 < do not!

  * a. shoot in 50i
  * b. edit, backup in 50i
  * c. transmit in 50i
  * d. 99.99% chance is that HOME TV is the kind that will have to do some sort of  
    DEINTERLACING, since we are talking about PROGRESSIVE screens.
  * e. Will you post the copy on the web interlaced as well?

### HD case 2 < do yes!

  * a. shoot in 25p or 50p (25p should cover 95% of any regular boring broadcast, drama, film-like stuff, documentary, etc)
  * b. edit, backup in 25/50p
  * c. transmit in 50i, since for some reason this is a broadcast stream format at this point in time. (25p should fit nicely here, while for 50p>50i you will have to do some thinkering (oh no!!!))
  * e. Post on web as 25p or 50p or 50p>25p (another point of thinkering, do I want some artifical motion-blur here?).

### &#8220;Debate&#8221;:

#### people against case 2

  * but, but, we have this expensive 50i tech now! It&#8217;s called ergonomics. Who is going to pay for the upgrade to 50p? the routing infrastructure, graphics, etc, let alone the cameras?
  * A: a. shoot in 25p then b. This is how-to-do-it, not a freaking political/cost debate.
  * Go and watch a war report in iraq in 25p, it doesn&#8217;t look real, it looks like a film, a film is not the news.
  * A: I disagree, 25p looks like a film if: a. is shoot on film, b. if the digital intermediate was processed with a film-like LUT.
  * as long as you have the time and ability to perform reasonable deinterlacing for the web, 50i is still good enough.
  * A: good enough for what? Drama? Sports? Formula 1? (and no, &#8220;we&#8221; do not have that ability)

#### people for case 2

  * interlacing is the devil, search your feelings, you know it to be true.
  * In the future though, progressive content will upscale far better than Interlaced (It&#8217;ll be UHD/4k p50 with HDR before you know it.)

The End.
