or how to convert 50p to 25p camera footage (in this case this is a gopro3 footage shot at 50p (hd) with unknown shutter speed)

evil plan (after various tests);  
a. open AE CC, create 50p composition and drop this 50p edit into it (50p in 25p composition did not work that well)  
&#8211; add pixel motion blur &#8211; with manual shutter control, shutter angle 90, shutter samples 20, vector detail 20  
&#8211; render out to 50p intermediate (its SLOW, a min seems to need more than an hour)  
b. convert this with ffmpeg to your prefered final format using something like

<pre>ffmpeg -i in.mov yourcodecsettingshere -r 25 out_25fps.mov</pre>

Note that -r is just brutal droper/duplicator, it does not do any fancy frame blending or such.

observations;  
&#8211; There is no scene detection in the pixel motion blur (cuts will become slightly dissolvish or wipish some in a good and some in a bad way, but do the effect on source shots, not on master, if possible)  
&#8211; compression efficiency increases (using x264 crf 18 -tune film)
