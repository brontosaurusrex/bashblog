*Thinstall is an Application Virtualization Platform that enables complex software to be delivered as self-contained EXE files which can run instantly with zero installation from any data source. The core of Thinstall VS is the Virtual Operating System, a small light-weight component which is embedded with each “Thinstalled” application.*

*Requested programs come in two flavors:  
a. A one-time use build, which does not save any settings from the program  
b. A &#8220;sandbox&#8221; build, which saves your custom settings to the application folder*  
(when you create a folder called &#8220;Thinstall&#8221; in the same directory)*

*Thindownload offers a huge amount of free software in a portable, Thinstalled version. Every Thinstalled application consists of only one executable EXE file and there is no more need for an installation*
