*The GnuWin32 project provides Win32-versions of GNU tools, or tools with a similar open source licence. The ports are native ports, that is they rely only on libraries provided with any standard 32-bits MS-Windows operating system, such as MS-Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT / 2000 / XP. Native ports do not rely on some kind of Unix emulation*
