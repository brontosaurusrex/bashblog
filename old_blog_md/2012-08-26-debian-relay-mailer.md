`sudo apt-get install ssmtp `  
`gksu geany /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`

config file, ssmtp.conf:

# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=your.mail@gmail.com

UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthMethod=LOGIN

AuthUser=sentmail@gmail.com
AuthPass=lozinka

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
#rewriteDomain=

# The full hostname
hostname=kresnica

# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?

`sudo apt-get install mailutils`  
testing  
`sudo mail -s "hello there" your.mail@gmail.com`

(this seems to work, after testing nullmailer and postfix)
