so basically, options are:  
1. see if media manager does something cool (in my case this clips needs to be exported as rendered, that is with all the CC and defects apllied)  
2. *another way is to copy all your timeline clips into a new bin,  
then BATCH EXPORT.* (how to do that & will the defects apply to this clips?)  
3.* I just use in and out marks on the time line to output sections or clips. * <- this may just work as expected, but that's manual labor.

Nick says this:

*best thing is to get the clips into BIN in the browser.  
you can then do a batch export.  
FIle Menu > Batch Export, or right or control click on the items or bin </p> 

so as not to tie up FCP, the best thing is to simply export as QuickTime Movies.  
if there are no effects on the clips, then you can export as NON-SELF CONTAINED, or REFERENCE movies.  
then take those files and run them though compressor. 

if the clips are layered, or have rendered effects on them this is what to do: 

make a COPY of your sequence, put it in a new bin.  
go though the copied sequence defining the bits you want to export, either with in/outs (park on a clip, hit X), or by selecting.  
make a NEST of this selection (option C)  
name the nest, hit OK,  
and it will appear in the bin along with the sequence. 

when done, batch export as above. </em>
