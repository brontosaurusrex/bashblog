*SubtitleCreator allows you to create new subtitles for your DVD's. It has a Wizard interface, advanced synchronization features, DVD preview, and a simple WYSIWYG editor.*

untested, try to marry that with muxman,   
goal: to not start encore when only some 'text sub -> dvd sub' conversion is needed.
