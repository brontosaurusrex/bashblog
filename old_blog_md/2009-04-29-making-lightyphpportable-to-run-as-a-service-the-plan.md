evil plan:

it must run from a subst drive, which is a problem, since it is unclear how to mount such drive on boot, that is before services start, now the install\_and\_run\_lighty\_as\_a\_service.bat should look like (abstract):

0. subst the s: drive  
1. make some service named lighty:  
instsrv lighty servany  
2. haksor the registry that is connected to that new service, fill in the correct values to start the actual lightTPD.exe with correct parameters  
3. find a way that this service can run from virtual drive, make a bacth just for subst s: and run that batch from service when it fails the 1st time; snap:
