*Recoll is based on the very strong Xapian search engine library, for which it provides a powerful text extraction layer and a complete, yet easy to use, Qt graphical interface.*

*It can search most document formats.  
It can reach any storage place: files, archive members, email attachments, transparently handling decompression.  
One click will open the document inside a native editor or display an even quicker text preview.  
The software is free, open source, and licensed under the GPL.*

note: also usable from cli
