b. open 16bpc project in afterFX (can also be changed later)  
c. import openEXR files/sequences   
d. rmb click on footage and interpret footage | turn off 'interpret as linear light' in Color Management  
e. check alpha interpretation  
f. apply curves effect to get some details out from the low and medium tones.
