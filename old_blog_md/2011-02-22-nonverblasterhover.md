quote: *The NonverBlaster:hover is a mod of my Flash-based Video-Player »NonverBlaster«&#8230;*

&#8220;here would be a player, but i disabled the plugin&#8221;

problems:  
a. behaviour: you have to target the play button to start playback at start (instead of just clicking anywhere on the window)  
b. bug: the mouse cursor never seems to go away in fullscreen mode.  
c. bug: the bottom scroller will not go away when coming out of fullscreen mode.  
d. behaviour: the volume is always reset to some default value instead of storing latest user setting in a cookie.

questions:  
a. the readme states that &#8216;Ensure you have a wp_head() call within your theme.&#8217; <- what&#8217;s that all about?
