And it seems to work fine:

normal:  
čšžČŠŽ

html embeded:  
čšžČŠŽ

realated: atom feed shows wrong charset, removed from index.php, so that the browsers like firefox will now select rss.php as default (which is correct).

quote:  
*For those of you like me who would like an English UTF-8 version, so you can include non-Latin characters in your blogs (useful if you want mathematical symbols for example) then here is what you need to do: </p> 

1. open the sphpblog/language folder,   
2. duplicate 'english', renaming it to 'english-utf8'   
3. edit the 'id.txt' file within so that it has a suitable label, I set mine to &#8220;English UTF-8&#8243;   
4. edit the 'strings.php' file within, changing the two lines that have the ISO-8859-1 value to: 

// ISO Charset: ISO-8859-1   
$lang\_string['html\_charset'] = 'UTF-8';   
$lang\_string['php\_charset'] = 'UTF-8'; 

Now when you should see &#8220;English UTF-8&#8243; in you configuration options. Note that if you had already entered accented characters previous to this change in your blog, then you will need to open the entries up in a text editor and resave the files as UTF-8, otherwise the will be wrong. </i>
