ffmpeg-user mailing list specific rules:  
* Avoid top-posting. Interleaved replying is standard etiquette.  
an example of what you should NOT do

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting

* Do not hijack threads (replying to a thread and changing the subject  
line to something completely unrelated that was not being discussed  
within the original thread).

* Configure your mail client to break lines after 70-80 characters. (why exactly?)

How to provide the right information:  
* Use recent ffmpeg from Git or a supported version of ffmpeg (see  
download page) if possible.

* Show your ffmpeg command and the complete, uncut console output  
of your command.

* If you attach files avoid compressing small files; uncompressed is  
preferred. (that&#8217;s probably for patches/text files?)

* Use minimal commands to help narrow down what is causing the issue.  
Exclude filters and external encoders (usually anything lib*, such as  
libx264) if possible. (So there is no support for external encoders such as x264, vp8?)

* Provide a link to samples if applicable (see datafilehost.com or  
mediafire.com if you need a file service).

* Avoid posting command lines that use shell variables. We need  
commands that allow anyone to easily duplicate your issue.

* I was told off for using HTML format (on by default in gmail) &#8211; is that a rule?

* Deleting attributions is a tad impolite as well; I have to go upthread  
to find out who you were quoting.
