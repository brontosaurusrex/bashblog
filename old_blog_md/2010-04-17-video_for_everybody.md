*** is** simply a chunk of <abbr>HTML</abbr> code that embeds a video into a website using the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> `<video>` element, falling back to <cite>QuickTime</cite> and <cite>Flash</cite> automatically, without the use of JavaScript or browser-sniffing.*

Interesting idea, but it fails, my chromium on ubuntu 9.10 will play ogv html5 video, even when i have flash installed and there is higher quality mp4 file available (i&#8217;am pretty sure that the end user is not thinking this: i&#8217;d rather be html5 fun and watch crappy video), shrug.

p.s. note to myself: This kind of &#8216;automagic&#8217; cascading video stuff never works, ditch the idea completely.
