`sudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-nonfree`

![][1]

current problems with video tag & chromium:  
&#8211; there is NO fullscreen button (this is a deal breaker really)  
&#8211; decoding seems slow compared to standalone players  
other:  
&#8211; silly theora vs h.264 wars, I do not plan to encode two clips
