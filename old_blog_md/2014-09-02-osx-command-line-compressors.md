and  
`xz -k test.tar` (81.5 MB)  
or much better compression  
`xz -9evk test.tar` (51 MB) < 2nd (keka gui can decompress is to tar for example)  
or  
`7za a test.7z test.tar` (71.6 MB)  
or much better compression  
`7za -mx9 a testmax.7z test.tar` (51.1 MB) < a winner, since 7za is standalone/portable/single cli binary.
