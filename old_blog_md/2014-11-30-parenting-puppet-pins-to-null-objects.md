*  
Instead of working straight with the Puppet Tool to animate limbs, you can lock each Puppet Pin to a null object and constrain them to other layers. The benefit of this is that it allows a hierarchy of movement between each pin and even layers, it also gives you the advantage of rotation and I find it much easier to undo changes if necessary.*
