so here it is, the frozen cloud is 32 bit png which should render natively in ie7, firefox and opera, ie6 hack is applied as described here:

(not so sure if that is very wise thought)

edit: to fix ie7 wrong? usage of the gama png property use a tool like TweakPNG to simply remove the gama metatags&#8230; (render is still not exactly the same if compared with firefox, but close enough.)
