Cuttermaran is a cut program for MPEG1 or MPEG2 video streams. The streams can be cut without recalculation. The asynchronous between audio and video will be minimized.</p> 

Cuttermaran supports frame accurat editing, but you will need TMPGEnc 2.5 for smart rendering. There are available a few freeware encoders, too. Take a look at the provider section.</i>
