*Tag is a command line tool that may be used to tag numerous audio files, using various tagging schemes, including ID3v1, ID3v2, APEv1, APEv2, Vorbis and Flac.</p> 

Tag can tag files automatically from their filename, by attempting to guess the filename format from one of fifty presets. You can also view tags for files, and create playlists.</i>
