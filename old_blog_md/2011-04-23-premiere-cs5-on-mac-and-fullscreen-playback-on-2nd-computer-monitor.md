*To set this up, right-click the &#8220;wing&#8221; menu in the Program Monitor, or that little triangle on the upper right, and choose Playback Settings, which opens the dialog shown in Figure 5. Choosing Monitor:2 displays the video preview on your second monitor; choosing DV displays it on your DV device or a monitor attached thereto. *
