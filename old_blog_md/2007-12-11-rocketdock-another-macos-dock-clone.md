*RocketDock is a smoothly animated, alpha blended application launcher. It provides a nice clean interface to drop shortcuts on for easy access and organization. With each item completely customizable there is no end to what you can add and launch from the dock.</p> 

Now with added Taskbar support your minimized windows can appear as icons on the dock. This allows for better productivity and accessibility.</i>
