&#8211; art is allready there  
&#8211; confusing navigation and definiton of web pages  
&#8211; and yes, you really should not use default wp theme  
&#8211; too much of everything (I really don&#8217;t care at this point and in some point in the future i&#8217;d like to vote for the sketches and storyline)  
&#8211; weirdly overexposed side heroes and different hero experiments  
&#8211; short definition of the movie and blender mentioned should really be all there is, like:

With Blender and its about : *the sheep, who&#8217;s longing to get an interesting life. It will be a funny, absurdist and adventurous love story.*

p.s. The only amazing (about 2s) animation I saw so far is falling sheep btw.
