*lunr.js is a simple full text search engine for your client side applications. It is designed to be small, yet full featured, enabling you to provide a great search experience without the need for external, server side, search services.</p> 

lunr.js has no external dependencies, although it does require a modern browser with ES5 support.</em>

<http://jssindex.sourceforge.net/>

*JSS is a simple search engine designed for CDROM or Web-based document collections. The documents to be indexed can be in HTML, PostScript (.ps and .ps.gz), PDF, and DjVu. The main feature of JSS is that the query engine and the index are entirely in JavaScript, and therefore require no other software than a JavaScript-enabled Web browser.</p> 

What is the advantage? If you are distributing a collection of document on CD-ROM, you can provide platform-independent full-text search without asking your users to install any software on their machine. If you publish a collection of documents on the web, you don&#8217;t need to install any server-side scripts: search queries run entirely in the user&#8217;s web browser.</em>

[http://reyesr.github.io/fullproof][1] < looks good

*Fullproof is a javascript library that provides high-quality full-text search in the browser.</p> 

This specially makes sense if your webapp is designed to work offline, using the HTML5 offline feature or because your application runs on a possibly disconnected mobile device.
